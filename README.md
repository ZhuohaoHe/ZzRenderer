# ZzRenderer
An OpenGL 3d graphics renderer 

+ **Model Loading** from .obj Files: Implemented a robust pipeline for loading 3D models, decomposing them into meshes and materials using Assimp.
+ **Uniform Buffer Objects** (UBO): Optimized uniform variable management with UBOs, improving rendering performance and code organization.
+ **Normal Mapping**: Enhanced visual detail by implementing normal mapping with tangent space calculations for accurate lighting.
+ **Framebuffer and Post-Processing**: Developed a framebuffer system for off-screen rendering and multiple post-processing effects.
+ Cubemap and **Skybox**: Created dynamic skyboxes with cubemaps, supporting reflections and refractions for immersive environments.
+ **Anti-Aliasing** with MSAA: Applied Multisample Anti-Aliasing (MSAA) to reduce aliasing artifacts and enhance visual quality.
+ Lighting: Implemented direct lighting and point lights for realistic shading and dynamic scene illumination.
+ ImGui Menu Integration: Integrated ImGui for an interactive user interface, allowing real-time control over rendering parameters.
